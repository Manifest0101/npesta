# Npesta
You probably know **Npesta** for all the memes that have been made of him, most likely his renowned overdone reaction to verifying kenos. Casting aside the memes, Npesta is a really cool geometry dash youtuber, known yet again for verifying kenos (Top 4 extreme demon as of 8/2/2020) and having a quote "interesting" reaction to beating it. 

## What is this?
This repository contains **131 frames** of Npesta's reaction. This all started when I wanted to make a discord bot that puts the reaction in your avatar as a gif. I ran into many issues and spent a lot of time restarting, rewriting and improving. By the date 4/18/2021, I believe I created the best version yet, despite there being a few improvements I know I can do. 
- `/links.js` | This contains all 131 frames in discord links.
- `/object.js` | Contains a Javascript object with face pixel coordinates. (I wanted to use JSON, but JS was slightly more convenient)
- `/npesta reaction/` | Folder contains all 131 frames as png files.

**Note:** *I have noticed that the `npesta reaction` folder does not have the images in order (1-131), however download the repo should theoretically order them!*
